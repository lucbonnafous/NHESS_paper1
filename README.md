# NHESS_paper1
This folder contains codes used to produce the paper "Space-time clustering of climate extremes amplify global climate impacts, leading to fat-tailed risk"

Input climate data was repackaged from http://digital.csic.es/handle/10261/128892, and the repackaged files are not uploaded here due to file upload limitations. 

The version of the code used precisely for the paper was lost and I am still working on recreating the exact codes (while also working on updated version). PLease ask any question and request any code if you have questions.
